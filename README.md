As a postgraduate in Science with a major in Physics from the Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research, Mohali, I bring a strong foundation in programming, statistics, mathematical modeling, and analytical thinking to the field of data science. During my college days, I developed a keen interest in data through extensive exposure to various kinds of data and hours of contemplation, making it a natural progression to pursue a career in this field.

I am well-versed in a variety of programming languages such as Python, R, and SQL, and have experience using statistical tools and techniques such as regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and machine learning algorithms. I also have a solid understanding of mathematical modeling, which I have applied in several projects to build predictive models for various real-world applications.

In addition to my technical skills, I am an analytical thinker who can break down complex data sets into actionable insights. I am also highly motivated and possess excellent communication skills, allowing me to clearly present findings and collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams.

I am confident that with my years of exposure to programming, statistics, mathematical modeling and analytical thinking, I will be able to make a significant impact in the field of data science. I am eager to bring my skills and knowledge to a dynamic organization where I can continue to grow and develop as a data scientist while contributing to meaningful and impactful projects.
